= Summary =
 



We motivate to research the general purpose Chinese character recognition (Part of the recent results have been published as a serial of papers). After three years' work, we compiled _HIT-MW_ (*HIT* is the abbr. of Harbin Institute of Technology, and *MW* means it is written by Multiple Writers), a handwritten Chinese text database for the first time in handwriting recognition domain. 

 

Comparing to previous handwritten databases, our database has at least three distinctions. First, the handwriting is naturally written with no rulers that can be used to make the text-line straight by and large. This feature makes it suitable for conducting experiments on Chinese text-line segmentation. Second, the underlying texts for handcopying are sampled from China Daily corpus in a systematic way and the writers are carefully chosen to give a balanced distribution. Third, it is collected by mail or middleman instead of face to face, resulting in some real handwriting phenomena, such as miswriting and erasing. 

 

Besides text-line segmentation, the *HIT-MW database* is fit to research segmentation-free recognition algorithms, to conduct handwriting identification experiments (The dataset is available upon request and Here is a brief summary ), to evaluate your signature verification algorithms (This kind of dataset is under construction),  to verify the effect of statistical language model (SLM) in real handwriting situation, and to study the nerve mechanism of Chinese handcopying activity.  Till now, at least THIRTEEN Institutes or Universities are using HIT-MW database in their experiments over the world. Though the database can be downloaded freely, you need an authority letter from us before publishing your papers (Here is an template of authority letter ). 

 

In *HIT-MW database*, more than 780 participants produce their handwriting naturally. We have collected 853 legible Chinese handwriting samples. There are 186,444 characters in total including letters, punctuations besides Chinese characters, and these characters lead to 8,664 text lines. By simple computation, we get following statistics: Each sample has 10.16 text lines; Each text line has 21.51 characters; Each sample includes 218.57 characters. More specific information is described in http://hitmwdb.googlepages.com/ .
